            The process of dropping out neurons that specifies the probability of an input unit being dropped. 
            For example, a dropout rate of 0.2 means there's a 20% chance that any given unit is dropped during training.
            Dropout is particularly useful in large neural networks and is a key technique to combat overfitting, 
            ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
